# 🔐 MyOwnPassManager

A secure, lightweight command-line password manager built with Python.  
Passwords are encrypted using symmetric encryption and protected by a master authentication system with environment-based access verification.
**This project is for educational purposes and not intended for production use.**

---

## ✨ Features

- 🔒 **Master Password Protection** – Secure access control before vault access  
- 🛡️ **Encrypted Storage (Fernet / AES)** – All credentials are encrypted before storage  
- 🌐 **Environment-Based Access Verification** – Optional MAC address validation or remote API availability check  
- 💻 **Command Line Interface** – Fast, minimal, and efficient workflow  
- 📦 **Lightweight & Portable** – Runs anywhere Python 3.6+ is installed  
- 🗄️ **MongoDB Support** – Secure database-backed storage
